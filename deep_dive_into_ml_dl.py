        Use Case/Example: L1 regularization is used in feature selection in linear models. L2 regularization is used in ridge regression to mitigate overfitting in complex models.
55.	Generative Adversarial Network (GAN): → 
        Definition: GANs are a class of neural networks where two networks, a generator and a discriminator, are trained simultaneously with opposing goals—the generator creates data, and the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated data. 
        Explanation: The generator aims to produce realistic data, while the discriminator aims to identify fake data. This adversarial process improves the quality of generated data over time. 
        Use Case/Example: GANs are used in image synthesis, where they generate realistic images from noise, such as creating high-resolution photos or generating images of non-existent people.
56.	How to Remove Outliers: → 
        Definition: Removing outliers involves identifying and eliminating data points that significantly differ from the rest of the dataset. 
        Explanation: Common methods include statistical techniques like the IQR method, Z-scores, and domain-specific rules. Removing outliers can prevent them from skewing analysis and improving model performance. 
        Use Case/Example: In sales data analysis, outliers representing unusually high sales might be removed to better understand typical sales patterns.
57.	Cross-Validation: → 
        Definition: Cross-validation is a technique for assessing the generalizability of a model by partitioning the data into multiple subsets, training on some and testing on others. 
        Explanation: The most common form, k-fold cross-validation, splits the data into k subsets and iterates through training on k-1 subsets while testing on the remaining one. This provides a more reliable estimate of model performance. 
        Use Case/Example: Cross-validation is used in tuning hyperparameters of machine learning models to ensure they generalize well to unseen data.
58.	Selection Bias: → 
        Definition: Selection bias occurs when the sample used in a study is not representative of the population intended to be analyzed, leading to skewed results. 
        Explanation: It can arise from non-random sampling methods, attrition, or other factors that cause the sample to differ systematically from the population. 
        Use Case/Example: In clinical trials, selection bias might occur if the participants are all volunteers from a specific demographic, potentially misrepresenting the general population.
59.	Stemming: → 
        Definition: Stemming is the process of reducing words to their base or root form. 
        Explanation: Stemming helps in normalizing words by stripping suffixes to create a common base form, which can improve text processing tasks like search and indexing. 
        Use Case/Example: In a search engine, stemming allows searches for "running," "runs," and "ran" to match documents containing the root form "run."
60.	Lemmatization: → 
        Definition: Lemmatization is the process of reducing words to their base or dictionary form (lemma), considering the context. 
        Explanation: Unlike stemming, lemmatization considers the part of speech and context, producing more meaningful base forms. 
        Use Case/Example: Lemmatization is used in natural language processing tasks, such as text mining, to improve the accuracy of information retrieval by ensuring words are in their most informative form.
61.	Sensitivity (Recall): → 
        Definition: Sensitivity, also known as recall, is the proportion of actual positive cases that are correctly identified by the model. 
        Explanation: Sensitivity measures the model’s ability to capture all relevant instances. High sensitivity is crucial in applications where missing positive cases is costly. 
        Use Case/Example: In medical diagnostics, high sensitivity is essential to ensure that patients with a disease are correctly identified for further testing or treatment.
62.	Specificity: → 
        Definition: Specificity is the proportion of actual negative cases that are correctly identified by the model. 
        Explanation: Specificity measures the model’s ability to correctly reject non-relevant instances. High specificity is crucial in applications where false positives can have significant consequences. 
        Use Case/Example: In spam detection, high specificity ensures that legitimate emails are not incorrectly flagged as spam, maintaining proper communication flow.
